// The algorithm starts at the root "starting" node
// and explores as far as possible along each branch until it 
// reaches the endpoint before backtracking.
// So the basic idea is to start from the root or
// any "starting" node and mark the node and move to the adjacent
// unmarked node and continue this loop until there is no unmarked
// adjacent node. Then backtrack and check for other unmarked nodes and traverse them. 
// Finally, show the nodes of the path from the starting point to the ending point.
